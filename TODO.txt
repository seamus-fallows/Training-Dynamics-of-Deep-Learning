- Implement multiple runs over parameters
- Make run_once() (or run() if created) to be more generic and applicable to different experiments 
- think about how to structure configs for multiple runs/comparative runs
- Implement comparative runner
- Implement wandb logging
- Make sure that in_size for data and model always match
- Make gamma/weight initialization optional so ExperimentBuilder is more general
- change max_steps for comparative_trainer.
- What dataclasses should I use??
- Comparative runner a function?
- model seed part of model class
